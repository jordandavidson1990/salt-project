    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Our mission is to provide a creative environment across our three spaces that champions collaborative, interdependent working. These artist led spaces include exhibition, community and residency working areas. Our spaces are intended as meeting places for discussion, skill sharing and building collaborative relationships. Salt Space is also a venue for creative events and activities which support the sustainability of our neighbourhood. Constitutionally, Salt Space is a co-operative founded by graduates and students from the Glasgow School of Art.</p>
