    <p>Our mission is to provide a creative environment across our three spaces that champions collaborative, interdependent working. </p>
    <br>
    <p>These artist led spaces include exhibition, community and residency working areas. Our spaces are intended as meeting places for discussion, skill sharing and building collaborative relationships. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Salt Space is also a venue for creative events and activities which support the sustainability of our neighbourhood. Constitutionally, Salt Space is a co-operative founded by graduates and students from the Glasgow School of Art.</p>
